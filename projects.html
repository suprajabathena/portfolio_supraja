        1.Crop yield prediction is one of the challenging tasks in agriculture.Predicting the crop yield in advance of its harves would help the farmers.<br></span>
        <span style="color: rgb(128, 218, 240); font-siz:60px;">
        2.Machine learning is an important decision support tool for crop yield prediction, including supporting decisions on what crops to grow and what to do during the growing season of the crops. Deep learning algorithm have been applied to support crop yield prediction and with the help of Deep Learning algorithm we can predict crop yield.<br></span>
        <span style="color: rgb(169, 240, 128); font-siz:60px;">
        3.Convolutional Neural Network is used. <br></span>
        <span style="color: rgb(128, 240, 130); font-siz:60px;">
       4. We choose CNN algorithm in deep learning, because deep learning solves complex machine learning issues and it also consists millions of data points. And the accuracy rate is high when compared with machine algorithm i.e., Random Forest Algorithm. </span>
